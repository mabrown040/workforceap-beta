    <p><strong>${MEMBER_WELCOME_LETTER_TITLE}</strong></p>
    <p>Thank you for becoming a member of Workforce Advancement Project!</p>
    <p>We are pleased to welcome you to a community committed to helping individuals strengthen their skills, advance their careers, and improve their economic opportunities.</p>

      'Assistance identifying grants, scholarships, and sponsorships that may help cover training costs',
    ])}
    <p><strong>Our Two-Platform Process</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. AI Workforce and Job-Readiness Platform</strong></p>
    <p>You have successfully registered for our complimentary member platform. This platform provides AI-powered tools to help you:</p>

    <p><strong>2. Occupational Training and Professional Certification Platform</strong></p>
    <p>Registration as a Workforce Advancement Project member does not automatically enroll you in an occupational training or professional certification course.</p>
    <p>Before enrollment, a Workforce Advancement Project Career Advisor will:</p>
    ${bullets([

      'Discuss your career goals',
      'Evaluate your foundational skills and readiness',
      'Review your career and technical assessments',

      'Discuss possible funding options',
    ])}
    <p>If we mutually determine that a program is appropriate, we will explain the next steps for enrollment. Many of our professional certification programs include approximately 160 hours of training.</p>
    <p><strong>Training Funding Opportunities</strong></p>
    <p>Workforce Advancement Project individually reviews each application to identify possible grants, scholarships, or sponsorships that may help cover training costs. Funding is not guaranteed and is subject to eligibility requirements and availability.</p>
    <p>You may qualify for assistance through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) if you have been laid off, are unemployed or underemployed, or meet certain income or public-assistance guidelines.</p>

Find your local One Stop Center by using this link and putting in your zip code. If you believe you may qualify, contact your local office and ask about <a href="${WIOA_DOL_URL}">WIOA Adult or Dislocated Worker training assistance</a>.
